## PLAN

- Create react app with ( npx create-react-app ).
- Remove all the unneeded files.
- Clear files from unnecessary comments and lines.
- Prepare the assets and fonts needed for the project.
- Make a repository component to put all website components in.
- Build the components from the navbar until the footer.
- Use react-routes-dom to surf through links.
- Get information from the api provided with axios.
- Fill the front with information from the api.

## NOTE

The frontend is successfully created. Unfortunately i console logged the api but i couldn't output it in the frontend because i run out of time.
I hope you like my work! ^^
